# Retail / Demon Hunter Rotation
## Warning
I created this rotation to quickly run with my friends on Retail WoW, so it is not universal. If you want to use it, just 
DM me **AmsTaFFix#0047** and i'll make that rotation more universal :)

## Backlog

## Tuning
File `01_amstaffix_demonhunter_havoc.lua` has Config lua table with some tune options, you can change as you like
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter problems you should:
